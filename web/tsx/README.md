## Template for modern WEB dev

The goal for this spike is making a combination of E6 modules, react, bootstrap and typescript.

Making new projects without ES6 modules just makes sense now a days, and using jspm as
manager sounds promising, so this need to be tried out.

React sounds interesting, and using it together with typescript is just too tempting.

jspm offers both packing and trans coding, and both would be extremely helpful for future projects.

Many nice frameworks have been made available lately, but bootstrap remain the most
used, and as this template is not about css and UI design, this seemed like a sensible
default.
