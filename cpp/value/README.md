= Dynamic value system =

  Define a dynamic value system that uses modern C++, as much of the rtti as
  possible and as C++ natural to use as I can imaging.

  On of the main reasons for using dynamic values in C++ are integrations to
  a more dynamic world, like the web where Javascript have made JSON the
  defacto way of exchanging data.
